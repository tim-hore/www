The turning point where American Animals finally won me over and will for anyone else not entirely sold, boils down to a third act reveal that makes clear why writer and director Bart Layton has chosen to include documentary-style cutaway interviews to the real-life subjects of the Transylvania University art heist incident (now middle-aged, and if my math is correct, in their 30s) drip feeding different versions of the truth (a narrative device most recently seen in the outstanding Tonya Harding biopic I, Tonya, barring the usage of real-life counterparts). Is it a little late to completely redeem the movie into something truly special? Yes, but by the end, there is no denying that Bart Layton (most known for the documentary The Imposter) has once again found a creative way to play with the structure of biopics and reality versus dramatization.

American Animals also has a terrific small ensemble of bright young actors, but it is Keoghan and Peters who stand out thanks to receiving the most material along with juxtaposed opposite lives despite their close friendship, and itâ€™s great that in 2018 we can say that heist films are finding new ways of coming across as refreshing.

Sinopsis: Four young men mistake their lives for a movie and attempt one of the most audacious heists in U.S. history.
